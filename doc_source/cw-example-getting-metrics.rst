Getting Metrics from |CW| with the |sdk-go|

   :description: Use this code example to learn how to retrieve a list of published CloudWatch metrics and publish data points to CloudWatch metrics in Go.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go examples, CloudWatch, alarm actions

These Go examples show you how to retrieve a list of published |CW| metrics and publish
data points to |CW| metrics with the |sdk-go|, as follows:

* Listing metrics
* Submitting custom metrics

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <cloudwatch>` repository on GitHub.

.. _cw-get-metrics-scenario:

The Scenario
============

Metrics are data about the performance of your systems. You can enable detailed monitoring of
some resources, such as your |EC2| instances, or your own application metrics.

In this example, Go code is used to get metrics from |CW| and to send events to |CWE|.
The code uses the |sdk-go| to get metrics from |CW| by using these methods of the |CW| type:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListMetrics <service/cloudwatch/#CloudWatch.ListMetrics>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`PutMetricData <service/cloudwatch/#CloudWatch.PutMetricData>`

.. _cw-get-metrics-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have  :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |CW| metrics. To learn more,
  see :cw-dg:`Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics <working_with_metrics>` in the |CW-ug|.

.. _cw-example-list-metrics:

List Metrics
============

Create a new Go file named :file:`listing_metrics.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/cloudwatch/listing_metrics.go
   :lines: 15-23

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load configuration, credentials, and
region information from the shared config file, ~/.aws/config, and create a new |EC2| service client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/cloudwatch/listing_metrics.go
   :lines: 27-34

Call ``ListMetrics``, supplying the metric name, namespace, and dimensions. Print the metrics returned in the result.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/cloudwatch/listing_metrics.go
   :lines: 37-53


.. _cw-example-custom-metrics:

Submit Custom Metrics
=====================

Create a new Go file named :file:`custom_metrics.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/cloudwatch/custom_metrics.go
   :lines: 15-23

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load configuration, credentials, and
region information from the shared config file, ~/.aws/config, and create a new |EC2| service client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/cloudwatch/custom_metrics.go
   :lines: 27-34

Call ``PutMetricData``, suppylying the metric name, unit, value, and dimensions. Print
any errors, or a success message.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/cloudwatch/custom_metrics.go
   :lines: 37-60
