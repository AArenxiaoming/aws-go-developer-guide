   :description: Use S3 code examples to write your own Go applications.
   :keywords: AWS SDK Go examples, Amazon S3

The |sdk-go| examples can integrate |S3| into your applications. The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK (that is, you've imported all required packages and set your credentials and region). For more information, see :doc:`setting-up` and :doc:`configuring-sdk`.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the :doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <s3>` repository on GitHub.
